# Air Quality Sensor Assembly Guide

## Introduction

This guide walks you through building an air quality monitoring system using Arduino-compatible components. The finished device will measure temperature, humidity, CO2, VOC/NOX, and particulate matter, log data to an SD card, display readings on an OLED screen, and optionally upload data to Google Sheets via WiFi.

This project is designed for students and educators in STEM programs, requiring basic electronics skills that will be developed throughout the assembly process. By completion, you'll have hands-on experience with soldering, Arduino programming, sensor integration, and data visualization.

**What you'll build:** A portable air quality sensor that can monitor indoor/outdoor air conditions and track environmental data over time.

**Time required:** Approximately 6-8 hours across multiple sessions

**Prerequisites:** Basic familiarity with computers and willingness to learn electronics fundamentals

<!-- Internal Notes:
-make doc headers smaller
-gray pages on docs
-make 3d printed or wood chunk for trimming
-JST cables for pcb sen5 is different sequential order than breadboard connector
-add screw and jst cable to parts list
-new fritzing with jst ordering
-update markdown on github readme page & links to docs
-kendra compile docs as is
