# Air Quality Sensor V5 
### With: provisioning, SEN55 PM and SCD41 CO<sub>2</sub> sensors, PVC enclosure and PCB mounting

Welcome to our ASRC Community Sensor Lab! We're still building this space but feel free to use the materials available. Contact [kkrueger@gc.cuny.edu](mailto:kkrueger@gc.cuny.edu) if you have any questions. We'll try to answer as soon as possible!
 
The Air Quaity Sensor (AQS) is a **low-cost, low-power** DIY device with sensors for **CO<sub>2</sub>, temperature, pressure, relative humidity, PM2.5** (dust or smoke), **VOC** (Volitale Organic Compound), and **NOx** (nitric oxide NO and nitrogen dioxide NO2). It has an on-board logger to a memory SD card and a WiFi radio chip to connect to Google Sheets for real time data reporting.<br>
The Air Quality Sensor V5 has a provisioning function to upload the WiFi name, password and Google Sheets information to the sensor without having to modify and upload the code. It keeps the last input used to connect to the most recently connected WiFi and Google Sheet. Provisioning can be changed or initiated with a button.

### Solar Integration ‚òÄÔ∏è 
The Air Quality Sensor can be powered by the sun!
For instructions on getting the AQS connected to a solar panel visit our document guide: [Solar Integration for the AQS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q-aV4gpCV_NFu_VYhCmv1KPlE8r25asAGBMgROmjtNk/edit?usp=sharing).


## Versions üõ†
### Air-Quality-Sensor-V4
This is currently still being worked upon. The code has been updated to allow communication from the google sheet to the sensor and allow provisioning so that the Wifi information does not need to be inputted into the code beforehand allowing it to be more versatile.[Upcoming-Version-4.0](https://github.com/Community-Sensor-Lab/Air-Quality-Sensor/tree/CSL-AQS-V4.0)
### Air-Quality-Sensor-V3
This is our current utilized version of code for our Air Quality Sensor. The code on this page is the latest code that is stable for usage. Bigger display screen, power booster, PM 2.5 and differential pressure sensors are included in this version [Version-3.0](https://github.com/Community-Sensor-Lab/Air-Quality-Sensor/tree/CSL-AQS-V3.0)
### Air-Quality-Sensor-V2.1
Code from version 2.1 of the Air Quality Sensor can be seen on the branch [Version-2.1](https://github.com/Community-Sensor-Lab/Air-Quality-Sensor/tree/CSL-AQS-V2.1)
### Air-Quality-Sensor-v1
Code from the first version of the Air Quality Sensor can be seen on the branch [Version-1](https://github.com/Community-Sensor-Lab/Air-Quality-Sensor/tree/Version-1)
