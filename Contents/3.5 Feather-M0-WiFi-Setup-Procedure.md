# Setup for a New Adafruit Feather M0 with WiFi (WINC1500)

This step is a one-time procedure for new, out of bag, [FeatherM0 WiFi boards](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3010) (Adafruit).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Requirements

**NOTE: This procedure only works with the old Arduino IDE that has the round icon <img src="../images/image1.png" width="64" height="64" alt="Arduino IDE V1.x"> **(V1.x)**

**It does not work on the new IDE with the square icon <img src="../images/image2.png" width="64" height="64" alt="Arduino IDE V2.x"> **(V2.x)**

## Step-by-Step Setup Process

### 1. Prepare Your Development Environment

Open the old [Arduino IDE (V1.x)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/OldSoftwareReleases). If you don't have it installed, download and set it up. You can have both versions on your computer.

### 2. Install Required Libraries

Check that the latest [WiFi101 library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/WiFi101) is installed. If not, install or update it through the Library Manager.

### 3. Load the Firmware Updater Sketch

Open the following arduino sketch: **Examples > WiFi101 > FirmwareUpdater**

### 4. Configure for Feather M0 WiFi

In the example, add the line of code shown below at line 43:

![Code modification for Feather M0 WiFi](../images/Adafruit_Feather_MO_WiFi1.JPG)

*This instruction sets the control pins in the program to work with the Feather M0 Wifi board*

### 5. Upload the Firmware Updater

Upload the code to your board. **Do not open the Serial Monitor.**

## Firmware Update Process

### 6. Open the Firmware Updater Tool

At the top of the Arduino IDE window, go to **Tools > WiFi101 / WiFiNINA Firmware Updater** as shown here:

You will get the following window:

### 7. Test Connection

Test the connection between your computer and the FeatherM0WiFi with **1. Select port of the WiFi module.**

### 8. Update Firmware

**2. Update Firmware.** Select the latest version of the [WINC1501 Model B](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATWINC1500) (19.6.1 in the picture above).

### 9. Configure SSL Certificates

**3. Update SSL root certificates.** 

- Select **Add domain**
- Enter [**www.google.com**](http://www.google.com)
- Repeat and enter **script.google.com** 

Your window should look like this:

### 10. Complete the Setup

Select **Upload Certificates to WiFi module** and the Feather M0 WiFi board is ready for use with Google.

‚úÖ ESP32 Provisioning Flowchart (Reference)
While this guide focuses on the Feather M0 WiFi board, many of the same principles apply to ESP32-based systems used in other CSL sensor builds. To help visualize the provisioning process‚Äîincluding WiFi setup, sensor initialization, and cloud integration‚Äîrefer to the flowchart below:

<div align="center"> <img src="../images/esp32_provisioning_flowchart.JPG" width="80%"/> </div>

This diagram outlines:

üîå Hardware setup and boot sequence

üì∂ WiFi credential input and connection logic

üå°Ô∏è Sensor calibration and data logging

‚òÅÔ∏è Optional cloud services integration

Use this as a reference when adapting firmware or onboarding new contributors working with ESP32 boards.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during this process:
- Ensure you're using Arduino IDE V1.x (not V2.x)
- Verify the WiFi101 library is properly installed
- Check that your board is properly connected and recognized by your computer
- Make sure you don't have the Serial Monitor open during firmware upload
