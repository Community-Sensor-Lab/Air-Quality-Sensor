# How to Assemble Air Quality Sensor Boards

This guide walks you through assembling your air quality sensor, focusing on attaching the boards onto the breadboard and testing each component systematically. Make sure that sensors and boards (with the exception of the SPS30 PM 2.5 Sensor) are soldered to the appropriate headers.

## üìã Materials Required

**Note:** Refer to the complete [Parts List](https://github.com/Community-Sensor-Lab/Air-Quality-Sensor/blob/master/README.md#Parts-List-) on GitHub for detailed specifications.

### Essential Components:
- [Breadboard](https://www.adafruit.com/product/239)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Initial Setup

1. **Prepare your workspace:** Have a clear breadboard in front of you. This will be your main assembly platform.

2. **Organize components:** Keep your FeatherM0 CPU & WiFi board nearby - this is the central hub that all sensors will connect to.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preliminary Configuration

### Setting Time and Date on Arduino Real Time Clock (RTC)

**Important:** Complete this step before assembling sensors to ensure accurate timestamping.

1. **Install Adalogger:** Insert Adalogger on top of the Feather M0
2. **Open RTC example code:** 
   - Navigate to Examples ‚Üí RTCLib ‚Üí Open pcf8523
3. **Modify the code:** Comment out lines 21, 22, and 34 (add `//` at the beginning of each line)

![RTC Setup](../images/Assemble_Air_Quality_Sensor_Boards2.JPG)

4. **Upload the code:**
   - Select correct board: Tools ‚Üí Board ‚Üí Adafruit SAMD boards ‚Üí Adafruit Feather M0
   - Select correct port: Tools ‚Üí Port ‚Üí Select the one with sensor
   - Click Upload

5. **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical:** DO NOT RESET/RESTART THE ARDUINO after uploading as this will reset the clock to compilation time. Instead, proceed directly to upload the main AQI code.

### SD Card Preparation

1. **Download formatter:** Get the official SD card formatter from [https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/)

2. **Format the card:** 
   - Connect SD card to computer (use SD card reader if necessary)
   - Open SD card formatter application
   - Format using recommended settings

## üîß Sensor Assembly & Testing

**Assembly Strategy:** We'll add and test each sensor individually to ensure proper functionality before final assembly.

### 1. BME 280 Environmental Sensor

**üìñ Reference:** [BME280 Datasheet](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-bme280-humidity-barometric-pressure-temperature-sensor-breakout.pdf)

**Function:** Measures temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity.

#### Placement & Wiring

![BME280 Placement](../images/Assemble_Air_Quality_Sensor_Boards4.JPG)

**Wiring Guidelines:**
- **Power:** Voltage connects to red line (+), ground connects to blue line (-)
- Follow the color coding in the image below for accurate connections

![BME280 Wiring](../images/Assemble_Air_Quality_Sensor_Boards5.JPG)

**Connection Map:**
- SCK/SCL ‚Üí Top row of breadboard
- SDI/SDA ‚Üí Second row of breadboard  
- VIN/3V ‚Üí Last row of breadboard
- GND ‚Üí Second to last row of breadboard

#### Testing BME280

1. **Load test code:** Open Examples ‚Üí BME280 test

![BME280 Code](../images/Assemble_Air_Quality_Sensor_Boards6.JPG)

2. **Add debugging code:** After `void setup()` and `Serial.begin();`, add:
   ```arduino
   delay(5000);
   Serial.println(__FILE__);
   ```
   This ensures you can verify successful code execution.

![BME280 Debug Code](../images/Assemble_Air_Quality_Sensor_Boards7.JPG)

3. **Upload and test:**
   - Connect board with USB data cable
   - Select board and port
   - Verify and upload code
   - Open Serial Monitor to view results
   - **Disconnect USB** before proceeding to next sensor

### 2. SCD41 CO2 Sensor  

**üìñ Reference:** [SCD-40 and SCD-41 Datasheet](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-scd-40-and-scd-41.pdf)

**Function:** Photoacoustic CO2 sensor measuring CO2 concentration in PPM (parts per million).

#### Placement & Wiring

![SCD41 Placement](../images/Assemble_Air_Quality_Sensor_Boards8.JPG)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Keep the BME 280 connected when adding SCD41 - it provides necessary pull-up resistors. Alternatively, you can use the OLED display which also has pull-up resistors.

#### Testing SCD41

1. **Load test code:** Examples ‚Üí Sparkfun SCD4x Arduino Library ‚Üí Example8_SCD41SingleShot

![SCD41 Code Selection](../images/Assemble_Air_Quality_Sensor_Boards9.JPG)

2. **Modify settings:** 
   - Change line 35 to `false false false`

![SCD41 Code Modification](../images/Assemble_Air_Quality_Sensor_Boards10.JPG)

   - Comment out lines 76-92

![SCD41 Code Comments](../images/Assemble_Air_Quality_Sensor_Boards11.JPG)

3. **Test:** Follow the same upload and testing procedure as BME 280
4. **Disconnect USB** before proceeding

### 3. SEN55 All-in-One Environmental Sensor

**üìñ Reference:** [SEN5x Datasheet](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/6791EFA0/62A1F68F/Sensirion_Datasheet_Environmental_Node_SEN5x.pdf)

**Function:** Comprehensive sensor measuring:
- Particulate matter (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4.0, PM10)
- Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
- Humidity and temperature
- Oxidizing gases (NOx)

#### Placement & Wiring

![SEN55 Placement](../images/Assemble_Air_Quality_Sensor_Boards12.JPG)

**Note:** Keep BME 280 connected for pull-up resistors (or use OLED display as alternative).

![SEN55 Wiring](../images/Assemble_Air_Quality_Sensor_Boards14.JPG)

#### Testing SEN55

1. **Load test code:** Examples ‚Üí Sensirion I2C SEN5x ‚Üí exampleusage
2. **Test:** Follow the same upload and testing procedure as previous sensors
3. **Disconnect USB** before final assembly

## üéØ Final Assembly

Once all individual sensors have been tested successfully, assemble all components together on the breadboard as shown:

![Final Assembly](../images/Assemble_Air_Quality_Sensor_Boards15.JPG)

**Final Steps:**
1. Carefully arrange all components according to the layout
2. Double-check all connections match the individual sensor wiring
3. Ensure no loose connections
4. Upload your main AQI monitoring code
5. Test the complete system
