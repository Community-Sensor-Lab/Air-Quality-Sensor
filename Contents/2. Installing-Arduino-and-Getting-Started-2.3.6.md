# Arduino Installation Guide

## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through installing Arduino IDE and setting up the necessary libraries for your sensor project.

## Step 1: Installing Arduino IDE

### Download Arduino IDE

To get started, make sure the **Arduino application** is installed on your computer or laptop. If it hasn't been installed yet, visit the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) to download and install it.

![Arduino Download Options](../images/download-options-sidebar.png)
![Windows Download Options](../images/file-location-desktop.png)

On the Arduino download page, choose the version that matches your computer's operating system.

### For Windows users:
- **Do not** select the **.zip file** option
- Instead, choose either **"Windows 64-bit App"** or **"Windows Installer"** for proper installation

### After the download is complete:
- **On a Mac**: The installer file will appear in your **Downloads** folder or on your **Desktop**
- **On Windows**: The installer file will typically be found in your **Downloads** folder
=======

**Important for Windows users:**
- **Do not** select the **.zip file** option
- Instead, choose either **"Windows 64-bit App"** or **"Windows Installer"** for proper installation

### Installation Process

**After the download is complete:**


**On Windows:**
- The file will typically be found in your **Downloads** folder or on your **Desktop**
- Open the file you downloaded — either the **64-bit App** or the **MSI Installer**
- Follow the prompts to complete the installation

**On Mac:**
- The zip file may appear on your **Desktop** or in your **Downloads** folder
- Open the downloaded zip file
- The Arduino application will appear—**drag it into your Applications folder** to install it

## Step 2: Arduino IDE Environment Overview

Now that the Arduino application has been installed successfully, open it. The Arduino IDE should look something like this:

![Arduino IDE Interface](../images/Installing_Arduino_236_Getting_Started4.JPG)

- This is where the code is written to run Arduino programs
- Any error messages will appear **in the margins of the black console window** when you run your code

## Step 3: Installing Required Packages and Libraries

Before running any programs on your **Arduino**, you must install a few essential packages and libraries. Without these, the Arduino won't be able to execute your code.

### Install Adafruit Board Package

This initial installation is required to give the Arduino application access to specific Adafruit libraries you'll need.

1. **Access Preferences**
   - Click on the Arduino drop-down menu and select Preferences (or Arduino → Settings)
   
   ![Arduino Preferences](../images/Installing_Arduino_236_Getting_Started5.JPG)
   ![Settings Menu](image-51.png)

2. **Add Board Manager URL**
   - Copy this link: **https://adafruit.github.io/arduino-board-index/package_adafruit_index.json**
   - Paste the link in "Additional Boards Manager URLs"
   
   ![Board Manager URL](../images/Installing_Arduino_236_Getting_Started7.JPG)

3. **Apply Settings**
   - Click "Ok" and close the Arduino Application

4. **Install Adafruit Boards**
   - Go to Tools → Board → Boards Manager
   
   ![Boards Manager](../images/Installing_Arduino_236_Getting_Started8.JPG)
   ![Boards Manager Window](../images/Installing_Arduino_236_Getting_Started9.JPG)

5. **Close Boards Manager**
   - Once you are done downloading the necessary boards, close the Boards Manager window

### Install Required Libraries

1. **Access Library Manager**
   - Go to Tools → Manage Libraries

2. **Install WiFi101 Library**
   - In the search bar type "WiFi101" and install the library called "WiFi101"
   
   ![WiFi101 Library](../images/Installing_Arduino_236_Getting_Started16.JPG)

3. **Install Additional Libraries**
   
   Repeat the search and install process for the following libraries (for libraries that require other libraries to be installed, click install all when prompted):

   - Adafruit Sleepy Dog
   - SparkFun SCD4X Arduino Library
   - Adafruit GFX
   - Adafruit SSD1306
   - Adafruit BME280
   - Adafruit SH110X
   - Sensirion I2C SEN5X
   - flashstorage
   - WiFi101
   - Honeywell TruStability SPI

4. **Install RTClib Library**
   - Download RTClib from [Github](https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib)
   - In Arduino IDE: Select Sketch → Include Library → Add .ZIP Library
   - Open the ZIP folder that you have just downloaded

**Installation Complete!** You now have all the necessary components installed.

## Step 4: Connecting and Testing Your Arduino

### Hardware Connection

1. **Connect Arduino to Computer**
   - Plug in your Arduino to your laptop using a Micro-USB Cable
   - If you do not have a USB port on your computer, you will need an adapter
   
   ![Arduino Connection](../images/Installing_Arduino_236_Getting_Started11.JPG)

### Software Configuration

2. **Select the Correct Port**
   - Launch Arduino IDE and select the correct port with the dropdown menu
   
   ![Port Selection](../images/Installing_Arduino_236_Getting_Started12.JPG)

### Code Compilation and Upload

3. **Compile Your Code**
   - When you have the correct port selected and you are ready to compile code to your Arduino, first compile the code to check for any errors beforehand
   
   ![Compile Code](../images/Installing_Arduino_236_Getting_Started13.JPG)

4. **Upload to Arduino**
   - When there are no errors present in the output, you can now upload the code to your Arduino
   
   ![Upload Code](../images/Installing_Arduino_236_Getting_Started14.JPG)

## Step 5: Testing Your Setup

### Running the Blink Example

Now that you have all the libraries downloaded, you can test the connection between the sensor and your computer.

1. **Load Blink Example**
   - Go to File → Examples → Basics → Blink to pull up the blink code
   - This code can be used to test if the sensor is connected to your computer and can have code uploaded to it
   
   ![Blink Example](../images/Installing_Arduino_236_Getting_Started15.JPG)

2. **Test the Connection**
   - Upload the code and look at the sensor when the code finishes uploading
   - Check if the light is blinking to confirm successful connection

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
- Ensure the correct port is selected
- Check that all required libraries are properly installed
- Verify your Arduino is properly connected via USB
- Review any error messages in the console window for specific guidance

Your Arduino setup is now complete and ready for sensor projects!
